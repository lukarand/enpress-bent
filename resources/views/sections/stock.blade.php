        <p class="font-size-md">ColorCote® MagnaFlow™ takes standard zinc/aluminium alloy-coated steel substrate to the next level with the addition of magnesium. This enables the zinc to ‘flow’ which seals the cut edges and prevents exposure to premature corrosion. This makes it an ideal material for harsher environments and for those located near the coast.</p>

        <p class="font-size-md">Bluescope  Zincalume® steel introduces magnesium into the aluminium-zinc alloy coating, improving galvanic protection by activating the aluminium. The result is a tougher protective coating that is more resistant to scratches and scuffs that can occur during construction. </p>
